Clinical Significance
The normal serum creatinine reference interval does not necessarily reflect a normal GFR for a patient. Because mild
and moderate kidney injury is poorly inferred from serum creatinine alone. Thus, it is recommended for clinical
laboratories to routinely estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a “gold standard” measurement for assessment of
renal function, and report the value when serum creatinine is measured for patients 18 and older, when appropriate
and feasible. It cannot be measured easily in clinical practice, instead, GFR is estimated from equations using serum
creatinine, age, race and sex. This provides easy to interpret information for the doctor and patient on the degree of
renal impairment since it approximately equates to the percentage of kidney function remaining. Application of
CKD-EPI equation together with the other diagnostic tools in renal medicine will further improve the detection and
management of patients with CKD.

v The reported results are for information and interpretation of the referring doctor only.
v It is presumed that the tests performed on the specimen belong to the patient; named or identified.
v Results of tests may vary from laboratory to laboratory and also in some parameters from time to time for the
   same patient.
v  Should the results indicate an unexpected abnormality, the same should be reconfirmed.
v  Only such medical professionals who understand reporting units, reference ranges and limitations of
   technologies should interpret results.
v  This report is not valid for medico-legal purpose.
v  Neither Thyrocare, nor its employees/representatives assume any liability, responsibility for any loss or
   damage that may be incurred by any person as a result of presuming the meaning or contents of the report.

   as "Clients".
v  Name - The name is as declared by the client and recored by the personnel who collected the specimen.
v  Ref.Dr - The name of the doctor who has recommended testing as declared by the client.
v  Labcode - This is the accession number in our laboratory and it helps us in archiving and retrieving the data.
v  Barcode - This is the specimen identity number and it states that the results are for the specimen bearing
   the barcode (irrespective of the name).
