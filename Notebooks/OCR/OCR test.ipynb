Because mild and moderate kidney injury is poorly inferred from serum creatinine alone. Thus, it is recommended for clinical laboratories to routinely estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a “gold standard” measurement for assessment of renal function, and report the value when serum creatinine is measured for patients 18 and older, when appropriate and feasible. It cannot be measured easily in clinical practice, instead, GFR is estimated from equations using serum creatinine, age, race and sex. This provides easy to interpret information for the doctor and patient on the degree of renal impairment since it approximately equates to the percentage of kidney function remaining. Application of CKD-EPI equation together with the other diagnostic tools in renal medicine will further improve the detection and management of patients with CKD.
