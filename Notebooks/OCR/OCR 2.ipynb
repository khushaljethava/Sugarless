Because mild\\nand moderate kidney injury is poorly inferred from serum creatinine alone. Thus, it is recommended for clinical\\nlaboratories to routinely estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a “gold standard” measurement for assessment of\\nrenal function, and report the value when serum creatinine is measured for patients 18 and older, when appropriate\\nand feasible. It cannot be measured easily in clinical practice, instead, GFR is estimated from equations using serum\\ncreatinine, age, race and sex. This provides easy to interpret information for the doctor and patient on the degree of\\nrenal impairment since it approximately equates to the percentage of kidney function remaining. Application of\\nCKD-EPI equation together with the other diagnostic tools in renal medicine will further improve the detection and\\nmanagement of patients with CKD.\\n\\nReference\\n\\nLevey AS, Stevens LA, Schmid CH, Zhang YL, Castro AF, 3rd, Feldman HI, et al.
